## A Carpentry Service Website

010HOUT is a carpentry service located in Rotterdam - The Netherlands. You can visit the page, get to know their work and contact the company for more information or to pay for their services, which includes: create new wooden furnatures or to provide mainteinence and restoration. 

010HOUT project idea was inspired on the business of a dutch carpenter friend.

The intention of this projected was to test my skills in HTML and CSS, more specifically the use of pseudo-elements.
